 # Streamlit Machine Learning Classification Dashboard

This Streamlit application provides an intuitive dashboard for users to upload a dataset, select a target feature, train a machine learning model, evaluate its performance, and download the trained model for further use. It's designed to facilitate quick and efficient data-driven decision-making without requiring deep programming expertise.

## Features

### 1. Data Upload
- **Description**: Users can upload their dataset in a DataFrame format.
- **Supported Formats**: Primarily supports `.csv` files. More formats can be added as needed.

### 2. Feature Selection
- **Description**: After uploading the dataset, the application displays the names of all features (columns) in the dataset.
- **User Interaction**: Users can select the target feature for model training using a dropdown menu.

### 3. Statistics Display
- **Description**: Basic statistics about the dataset are displayed to help users understand the data distribution and quality.
- **Statistics Include**: Count, mean, standard deviation, min/max values, and other relevant descriptive statistics.

### 4. Model Training
- **Description**: Users can train a machine learning model with a simple click of a button.
- **Models Supported**: Initially, basic models like Linear Regression or Decision Trees. More models can be added later.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Description**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated and various metrics are plotted.
- **Metrics Displayed**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve, etc.

### 6. Model Download
- **Description**: Users can download the trained model in `.pkl` format.
- **Usage**: The downloaded model can be integrated into other applications or used for further analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- **Feature Importance**: Display feature importance scores for the trained models.
- **Advanced Model Training**: Options to customize hyperparameters and training algorithms.

## Setup and Installation
- **Requirements**: Python 3.8+, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
